            <p>Bitcoin Cash Node (BCHN) is a full node project which aims to
              provide a safe client implementation for the BCH network, supported
              by an engaged community of professional developers, testers and
            supporting staff.</p>
            <p>Our software already functions as a drop-in replacement for Bitcoin
              ABC, following the longest chain for the May 2020 network upgrade
            without contributing to the risk of chain split.</p>
            <p>Our vision for BCH is for a network that is strong through both
              competition and cooperation, running on a diverse array of client
              software, living up to professional levels of development, maintenance
              and support. We will help create an environment where decisions are backed by
              research, evidence, and decision-making involves stakeholders and expertise
            from across the ecosystem.</p>
            <p>The Bitcoin Cash Node project has an open-door policy, welcoming all
              levels of expertise and all corners of the Bitcoin Cash. We discuss matters in
              the open, invite interested parties to participate, and hold ourselves to high
            standards of accountability.</p>
            <p>In this funding proposal, we hope to get the necessary resources to attend to
              some immediate needs of Bitcoin Cash miners, businesses and users, providing
              robust research and implementation for them. We also intend to put in place
              some necessary structure to ensure we are equipped to sustain ourselves through
            the next leg of challenges.</p>

          <h2 id="1-situation-assessment">1. Situation assessment</h2>
          <p>A cryptocurrency's most important attribute is its network. While marvelous
            technical advancements that catch headlines are very desirable, a cryptocurrency
            is nothing without a robust network of users, investors, and downstream
            developers who support each other. Different sectors have different needs, but
            they share the requirement that their upstream and protocol developers provide
            them with a robust, predictable environment to flourish in, minimize their cost
          of operation, and make sound decisions that objectively benefit everyone.</p>
          <p>In this regard, we must take a sober look at the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem today,
            and realize there is much to be improved. "Implementing the roadmap" sounds great
            but little attention has been paid to the soundness of approaches, robustness of
            less eye-catching practical matters such as RPC consistency, and reaching
            agreement among miners, businesses and developers. The result has been all too
            painful for all to see: Bitcoin Cash was a costly item to support for even its
            proponents, much of the time was spent on things that do not
            contribute to the network effect, and uncertainty about changes constantly
          riddle the scene without research and infrastructure to convince otherwise.</p>
          <p>Bitcoin Cash Node aims to change this, starting with a modest list of immediate concerns
            we want to tackle as we take a robust approach to the roadmap, giving priority
          to user and network growth at all times.</p>
          <h2 id="2-overall-objective">2. Overall objective</h2>
          <p>Bitcoin Cash Node, as a competing node and protocol development team, aims to
            provide a reliable, professional platform whose development is responsive to
            ongoing needs of the ecosystem. Base layer developers have dual
            mandates: Ensure network-sustaining growth can proceed without disruption, and
            provide steady progress towards implementing upgrades the ecosystem needs. With
          your support, we intend to fulfill both of them.</p>
          <p>Bitcoin Cash Node will provide a reliable, professional node software
            that can be used with confidence by everyone: miners, pools, exchanges,
            payment processors, merchants and assorted other businesses as well as
            home users. Changes will be researched and tested to the best of our ability,
            with accompanying data and assessments. We listen and justify our
          actions.</p>
          <p>With this proposal, we expect to gather the necessary resources not only to
            maintain code soundness and implement upgrades, with a focus on immediate
            ecosystem concerns, but also establish tools and infrastructure necessary to
            inspire confidence in Bitcoin Cash as a usable, promotable, reliable form of
          money. We invite you to join us.</p>
          <h3 id="commitment-to-a-diverse-client-landscape">Commitment to a diverse client landscape</h3>
          <p>We do not believe our lead maintainer, or indeed our team, should have sole say over
            network rules. This stance is reflected in our support and encouragement of
            initiatives that diversify the mining and application landscape, so that on top
            of our ongoing communication efforts, we are never in a dictatorial position with
          arbitrary power.</p>
          <p>The existence and adoption of other clients increase network robustness, attract
            more talent to the ecosystem and allow BCHN to do more good than if we have
          absolute say over a smaller, monoculture network.</p>
          <h2 id="3-scope">3. Scope</h2>
          <p>Our first fundraising proposal seeks to cover the following areas.
            Work will begin in May 2020. Note that early May 2020 is the projected end
          of this flipstarter campaign.</p>
          <p>As the deliverables are reassessed towards the end of 2020, we see ourselves
            providing feedback to the community, and collecting funds on focused items to
          carry out the next leg of our mission.</p>
          <p>For this initial fundraiser, our scope would cover the following under a
            proposed budget of 1122 BCH (of which 144 BCH were already donated before
          this campaign):</p>
          <ol>
            <li><p><strong>Compile existing Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm research</strong> and <strong>provide an
            improved solution</strong> over status quo. The new solution should feature faster, more
            robust adjustment that lessens disadvantage for "loyal" miners, while reducing
          variance as a benefit for user confirmation times.</p>
          <p><strong>Budget: 12k USD</strong> <em>(1 Full Time Equivalent (FTE) over a span of 3 months, end date early-mid August)</em></p>
          <hr>
        </li>
        <li><p><strong>Evaluate existing software regarding different scenarios of unconfirmed chain
        handling</strong> and <strong>identify bottlenecks</strong> in a clear fashion instead of arbitrarily
        asserting them. Improvement at (1) may lessen the urgency of extending the
        current 50 tx limit, but much longer chains remain a very desirable feature and
      should at least be seriously researched.</p>
      <p><strong>Budget: 9k USD</strong> <em>(0.9 FTE over span of 2.5 months from mid August to end of October)</em></p>
      <hr>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Provide a more robust testnet infrastructure</strong> that is useful for downstream
      developers. Bitcoin Cash's current testnet is far from robust - with irregular
      mining activities and patchy services (i.e. trest, SLP) availability.
      Experimental features and upgrades shall also be provided on a separate,
      volatile testnet that is serves as staging area for cutting-edge developers.
      A better testnet is one of the top requests from new developers and projects
      trying to enter the BCH ecosystem. The testnet is also commonly insufficient
      for existing project development. A small investment in a better testnet will
      help attract new projects, reduce defect rates and reduce cost of development
    on BCH.</p>
    <p><strong>Budget: 20k USD</strong> <em>(significant parts thereof infrastructure costs, &lt; 0.25 FTE, end date beginning of November)</em></p>
    <hr>
  </li>
  <li><p><strong>Research and implement ability to handle larger numbers</strong> beyond 32-bit, which
    significantly impacts ease of programming an entire class of smart contracts
  that provide financial value to Bitcoin Cash.</p>
  <p><strong>Budget: 24.8k USD</strong> <em>(2 FTE needed over a span of 3 months, end date early-mid August)</em></p>
  <hr>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Ongoing software maintenance and support</strong>. Backport important bug fixes and
  upgrades from Bitcoin Core, and provide our own fixes per user feedback. Fill
  the numerous gaps where specifications for existing features and protocols do
not exist.</p>
<p><strong>Budget: 104k USD</strong> <em>(~2.25 FTE over span of 6 months from early May to early November)</em></p>
<hr>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Development of ecosystem interaction processes</strong>. Establish regular contact
  with key stakeholders (exchanges, pools, miners, other large businesses and
holders) to get timely feedback.</p>
<p><strong>Budget: 30k USD</strong> <em>(for part time (12.5 hrs/week) assist to lead maintainer
over variable span starting in May)</em></p>
<hr>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Regular project reporting</strong> on roadmap, project governance, technical progress
  and financial accounting, including a monthly, no-holds-barred overview report
  to account for project commitments versus accomplishments. Instalments of this
  reporting has already been made available and can be tracked at
  <a href="https://read.cash/@freetrader">https://read.cash/@freetrader</a>.</p>
  <p><strong>Budget: 10.7k USD</strong> <em>(allocated to website development &amp; maintenance to aid
    in informing and reporting, shared responsibility between lead maintainer who
    is working full time on the project, and part-time community representative
  budgeted above.)</em></p>
  <hr>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Establish our own crowdfunding infrastructure</strong>.
  We plan to host our own focused fundraisers or use a third-party platform
  with assurance contracts as a path to voluntary, sustainable funding.
  As the Flipstarter team has made their implementation easily portable, we
plan to look at that option first, without ruling out other approaches.</p>
<p><strong>Budget: 10.12k USD</strong> <em>(~4kUSD for initial setup and development over 2 months
  starting early May, remaining funds for later development of 12 fundraising
campaigns. Needs ~0,5 FTE split between a front-end and back-end developer)</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The deliverables associated with these items are described in more detail
  in <a href="#4-deliverables">Deliverables</a>.</p>
  <p>Additional detail, including cost estimates, is contained in the section
    <a href="#5-scope-details">Scope details</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="4-deliverables">4. Deliverables</h2>
    <p>The following set of deliverables are practical, measurable goals intended to
    fulfill the aforementioned scope.</p>
    <p>Further details about how these deliverables will be realized, including
    staffing, schedule and budgets, are also attached.</p>
    <ol start="0">
      <li><p><strong>A capable team</strong></p>
        <p>Our team currently comprises a full-time lead maintainer doing much of
          the project planning and daily work supervision, assisted by several
          part-time maintainers some of whom also fill part time development,
          testing, support and infrastructure maintenance roles on the project.
          This group of essentially voluntary contributors comprises perhaps 2-3 FTE
        engineers working on the project.</p>
        <p>Additionally, there are developers with excellent qualifications who support
          the project in their spare time on a best effort basis right now, but could
        make specific time commitments given the right level of support.</p>
        <p>If funding goals are met, it allows us to be on more solid ground, whether in
          the form of more stable commitments from existing contributors or fresh help.
          This is estimated to comprise an additional 2 FTE of skilled and experienced
          developers which would be sufficient to cover our development workload
        (projected to reach about 4.5 FTE in the period from May to mid August).</p>
        <p>To improve project communication and representation and free up time
          of the lead maintainer to focus on steering the development and maintenance,
          the appointment of a part-time project representative is planned in the
        proposed budget.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p><strong>Evaluation report on Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm (DAA)</strong></p>
        <p>We will evaluate candidates in consultation with the wider ecosystem and
          clearly present the pros and cons of evaluated algorithms to the public.
        An evaluation report should be available early July.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p><strong>Specification, implementation and tests for proposed new DAA for November 2020 upgrade</strong></p>
        <p>A specification document for the best DAA candidate found by our preceding
          research activity (deliverable 1). To be published in final form, followed by
          implementation and tests, before feature freeze on 15 August 2020. Ecosystem
          agreement from preceding discussions will lead to us integrating the algorithm
          to BCHN client to be activated in November. We estimate that at least wallets
          adhering to the Electron-cash protocol (EC and Edge Wallet) or using
        Bitcoincashj will need assistance migrating, with more possible.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p><strong>Evaluate performance bottlenecks on unconfirmed tx chains</strong></p>
        <p>Benchmark that pertains to different scenario permutations regarding unconfirmed
          chains, and their impact brought on by different mempool policies. Part of the
          performance evaluation has been produced in previous debates and can be
        reused, but more scenarios need to be tested against.</p>
        <p>A technical report will describe the benchmark results, the bottlenecks
        identified and any recommendations for fixing them.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p><strong>A release configured to provide a separate testnet3 and experimental testnet</strong></p>
        <p>This should provide a robust test network capability to the project.
          It will be delivered in the form of infrastructure which will be made
          accessible through node configuration and instructions on how to access
        and participate on the testing networks.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p><strong>Continued testnet support</strong></p>
        <p>Establish stable services expected on a reliable testnet: Mining, a pool to be
          mined to, Electron-cash server (via Fulcrum or Electrs), SLPDB, and REST
          endpoint, and maintain reasonable levels of service for developers through
        the year.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p><strong>Handling larger numbers</strong></p>
        <p>A release that allows existing arithmetic opcodes to handle larger numbers,
          tentatively limited to 64-bit. Some concepts have been discussed in the previous
        upgrade cycle, and we intend to build upon them.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p><strong>Regular BCHN releases</strong></p>
        <p>As a result of maintenance efforts, we would be issuing minor releases
          which include software fixes and performance optimizations. These are
          important to keep our users safe from vulnerabilities, correct any existing
        defects and keep up with evolving platforms.</p>
        <p>Based on feedback from our users, we plan to provide these less frequently
        than two-week release cycle of another frequently used implementation.</p>
        <p>Instead, we aim for a 4-8 week release cycle, but hope to contain more
          poignant performance improvements while delivering parity on important
        backports.</p>
        <p>Once our independent fundraising campaigns are successful at funding new
          feature developments and some of those developments have run their course
          through to successful internal validation, then our releases will begin to
          include new features. Realistically, successful completion of those fund-
          raisers is still 2-3 months away and completion of new features several
        more, so we are looking at around Q3 / Q4 for feature releases.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p><strong>Appointment of BCHN representative</strong></p>
        <p>This deliverable consists of an introduction of the person appointed
          as BCHN Representative. The representative will help the lead maintainer to
          ensure that BCHN has continuous, professional, two way engagement with the
          larger ecosystem of users. The representative shall work together with
          lead maintainer to develop and implement a process of regularly obtaining,
        processing and presenting user feedback.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p><strong>Independent download mirror</strong></p>
        <p>The project would announce the availability of its own release host
          via its <a href="https://bitcoincashnode.org">website</a> [1], updates to the product's
        accompanying documentation and a read.cash announcement.</p>
        <p>Our initial release [3] and minor releases until that time would be transferred
        to the download mirror.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p><strong>Support service via GitLab Issue tracker and our Slack</strong></p>
        <p>The proposal funds our continued support of the node software through
        dedicated developer time.</p>
        <p>Such support will be given via GitLab and the #support channel in the
          <a href="https://bitcoincash.slack.com">Bitcoin Cash Node Slack</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><strong>Availability of our website in first other language (Chinese)</strong></p>
          <p>This will be a full translation of the website and any article content on
          it to Mandarin Chinese.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><strong>Our first own crowdfunding campaign for a technical item</strong></p>
          <p>This will demonstrate that we have an independent path to running our own
            fundraising campaigns, preferably using assurance contract technology
          like Flipstarter. It paves the way for more itemized and focused fundraisers.</p>
          <p>Our first own technical campaign will provide detailed breakdown of the
            feature, its perceived costs and benefits, and estimates of the work
            involved, resources needed and timeframe planned for its implementation
          from specification (if not already completed) until deployment.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><strong>Specification of auto-finalization, parking &amp; unparking</strong></p>
          <p>This closes a gap in the specification of consensus rules and benefits
            the entire node client landscape. Delivers a specification in the form of
            an erratum to the November 2018 upgrade specification which can be easily
          integrated into the shared BCH protocol specifications.</p>
          <p>This is sensitive consensus rule work which also requires modeling and
            testing against historical and generated test data, comparing with real
          nodes to verify that the resulting specification is completely accurate.</p>
          <p>Making available the model, tests and any needed data is part of the deliverable.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 id="5-scope-details">5. Scope details</h2>
      <p>This section describes the scope in more detail and gives the basis for
        estimates on budgets required, which are summarized in <a href="#6-budget">Budget</a>.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>NOTE: For budget estimates of development and maintenance work, an hourly rate
            of 100 USD is applied for estimates involving general development.
            This is based on mid-to-upper going rates [3] for offshore
            developers in regions like East &amp; South Asia, Australia, Africa.
            They may be on the low end for Western Europe and the US, but where
          specific skills are needed, work may be estimated at higher rate.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3 id="51-node-software-maintenance">5.1 Node software maintenance</h3>
        <p>Maintenance of the node software means giving support, fixing bugs (even
          those not yet hit by users, by backporting fixes others have detected and
          made upstream) and making sure the software continues to run on evolving
        hardware and software platforms.</p>
        <p>It also covers the infrastructure we maintain to provide releases (on
        Github, GitLab and via our own download servers once we set those up).</p>
        <p>Additionally, software quality assurance activities are included in this item.
          QA is addressed primarily through verification (review, testing and analysis)
        which are performed to find defects in the product before our users do.</p>
        <p>For such maintenance we budget as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><p><strong>Routine backporting of fixes from upstreams</strong></p>
            <p>average of 20 developer
              hours per week (half time equivalent). The project may individually contract
              with one or more developers to obtain the necessary time, and would
              budget using a rate of 100 USD / hr for a total item cost (for 6 months
            i.e. 24 weeks) of 48 kUSD.</p>
            <p>Developer resources not used for backporting can be refocused
            at the project's discretion on other maintenance or development activities.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p><strong>User technical support (GitLab issues)</strong></p>
            <p>currently low, but could ramp
              up quickly as our node software gains users. We estimate this
              over the next 6 months of 20 developer hours per week (half time equivalent).
              As above, this yields an additional budget item of 48 kUSD over the next
              6 months. Again, developer resources not used for user support can be
              refocused at the project's discretion on other maintenance or development
            activities, as needs dictate.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p><strong>Closing the "rolling checkpoints" specification gap</strong>.</p>
            <p>This is a technical
              gap in the specification of consensus rules which negatively impacts all
              clients that do not inherit ABC's code (as these rules are currently only
              implemented in code, but not properly specified as part of the protocol).
              This is sensitive specification work which also requires modeling and
              testing against historical and perhaps additional test data, to verify
              that the resulting specification is accurate.
              Making a mistake here could have a high cost on other implementations
            who might follow this specification.</p>
            <p>Some ground work has been done, but the remaining work is estimated at
              two weeks FTE (80 hrs) at 100 USD / hour, or 8kUSD.
              This work should be executed in a way that allows its easy integration
              into the shared BCH protocol specifications (<a href="https://reference.cash">https://reference.cash</a>),
              The common protocol specification is fairly general in the area of
              block validation and it might be difficult to create surrounding context
              in this budget, but it could be described as an erratum to the November
            2018 upgrade in 'Network Upgrades'.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p><strong>Informational site updates</strong>.</p>
            <p>This is part of routine maintenance,
            and there are several improvements we are looking to make:</p>
            <p><strong>Publications section on our site</strong> where we publish project news, important
            announcement, technical and financial reports.</p>
            <p>This is a minor item, but requires regular maintenance as the project
              publishes work articles.  A 6 month budget estimate is calculated at
            4800 USD, based on 8 hours / month and 100 USD per hour.</p>
            <p><strong>Internationalization</strong>: support for main language translations
              (we may start with Chinese to address mining and exchange users)
              It is vital for our project to inform a global audience about
              our product and services. Many Bitcoin Cash users are from non-English
              speaking countries and we would gradually want to reach many of them.
              To start we would like to offer our informational articles in Chinese,
              reaching an important market and many stakeholders in Bitcoin Cash.
              This is a bigger item for the website, as it requires both structural
              adaptation and professional translation of content as well as regular
            updating across all available translations as new content is added.</p>
            <p>A 6 month budget estimate is calculated on the following basis:</p>
            <p>2000 USD for adapting the site generally to host other languages.
              1000 USD for professional translation of the site structure and general
              content, excluding any full length news articles, into a single
              other major language and addition of that language onto the site.
              Additionally, about 100 USD for translation and review per posted
              full length report or article from English into another major language.
              We calculate on a basis of 4 such articles per month, for 400 USD / month
              or 2400 USD over 6 months <em>per language</em>. We start with one language
              (Mandarin Chinese) for a total amount of
              2000 + 1000 + 2400 = 5400 USD (for 6 months)
              In future, only new content and article will generate expenses, but
              after 6 months of operation we should have a good indication of what
              those costs are and can do more targeted fundraising for further
            site maintenance.</p>
            <p><strong>Hosting BCHN downloads ourselves</strong>, at least as a mirror. Estimating
              at 6-12 releases per year, with currently ~ 1GB storage per release,
              we need hosting space of about 20GB initially, growing per year.
              Adequate servers with 30GB are available at 10 USD / month, with about
              10 USD / month / additional 30GB of storage).
              We budget 120 USD for initial VPS rental for a 12 month period, and
              380 USD for server maintenance (incl. initial setup and system admin)
            over that period. Total: 500 USD.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="52-node-software-development">5.2 Node software development</h3>
        <p>In this proposal, only a limited selection of new feature developments
          are directly included. We believe in first demonstrating results before asking
          for more. Further feature developments will be proposed via separate
          fundraisers. These will cover specification, design, implementation and testing,
        deployment schedules and activation methods.</p>
        <p>Included in this proposal are the following research and development:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><p><strong>DAA R&amp;D to find and deliver a replacement difficulty adjustment algorithm</strong></p>
            <p>Conduct an evaluation and publish a report on it, presenting the pros
              and cons of the evaluated algorithms to the public.
              A preferred replacement algorithm shall be nominated.
              Estimated effort and cost: 40 hours at 100 USD / hour for a total

        <h3 id="53-self-funding-capability">5.3 Self-funding capability</h3>
        <p>Due to the global economic situation and the all-or-nothing nature of this
          initial Flipstarter fundraiser, we are not bundling many new node feature
        developments ("big ticket items") into this proposal.</p>
        <p>Assurance contracts (pledges are returned if funding goals are not met) are
          a crowdfunding model that has proven successful with the well known
        Kickstarter site.</p>
        <p>Feedback we have received so far indicates that splitting out future
          developments into well-described, self-contained funding packages with
          their own sub-project plans, budgets and schedules seems preferred both by
        our developers and by funders.</p>
        <p>We also feel such a funding approach is better in the long run, as it keeps
          the development direction of our client firmly in the hands of its users
        who will be able to control the funding on a relatively fine grained level.</p>
        <p>Therefore we propose a leaner, streamlined approach of a limited initial
          development with add-on crowdfunding campaigns.
          We are evaluating our options on whether to work with other companies who
          might be interested in creating a Flipstarter funding platform for profit.
          One initial estimate we have received from a company potentially interested
        in doing such a development was around 10kUSD.</p>
        <p>As we have some people with Flipstarter expertise in our team, we may decide
          to set this up more rapidly ourselves (simple campaign server based on
          initial Flipstarter site) and engage with external providers only for
        a longer term solution.</p>
        <p>In the case we set up our own Flipstarter hosting, we would require:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><p>Back-end engineering and enhanced hosting. Our current site is static,
            but Flipstarter needs more dynamic features for user pledge submission
            and transacting with the Bitcoin Cash network.
            It is likely that we would run the Flipstarter campaigns on a separate
            webserver.  Advice received indicates that it should be a straightforward
            to set up, with minimal hosting needs and could piggyback on existing domain.
            A budget is set at 20 hours for setup &amp; integration at 100 USD / hr
          and 120 USD for server hosting for a total of 2,120 USD.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Front-end development. Running campaigns ourselves will require some
          front-end work on presentation. Campaigns will probably vary in
          complexity from the simple to more elaborate.
          If we develop our own campaign hosting, we budget 20 hours for generic
          front-end campaign development at 100 USD / hr for total of 2,000 USD.
          We must anticipate smaller recurring costs for setup and front-end or
          back-end improvisations needed for new campaigns.
          We allocate a pool of around 500 USD per feature campaign which covers
        such setup as well as translation of the campaign text into Chinese).</p>
        <p>We would budget in advance for creating 12 such campaigns, for a total
          of front-end (2kUSD) + back-end (2.12kUSD) + campaigns (12 x 500USD)
        = 10.12kUSD.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>In the event that we receive an attractive offer to spend the budgeted funds
      on an external Flipstarter platform development, we may do so.
      The benefit of using an external service is that it might be less of a
      time drag on our own scarce developer resources. If such an external
      provider gains traction, we might benefit from a platform that improves
      itself and becomes easier to use over time. The downside would be dependence
    on a service provider for relatively critical fundraising activity.</p>
    <p>If we do not use up the budgeted funds for this self-funding capability
      (e.g. if we do it ourselves and it proves simpler than estimated, or we
      are able to obtain Flipstarter services cheaper via another platform), then
    the leftover funds would be used to for other improvement of our website.</p>
    <p>As prime candidates for future independently crowd-funded features we see:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p><strong>Secure JSON RPC connection</strong></p>
        <p>This is a low hanging fruit that would be useful to protect RPC traffic
          including credentials from snooping not only on the Internet, but also
          in local networks where nodes may be running behind NAT.
        Privacy improvement for users who run BCHN nodes to serve light wallets.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p><strong>Increased RPC compatibility with other nodes</strong> (e.g. BCHD's gRPC interface)</p>
        <p>This makes the BCHN software more useful as a redundancy option for those
          already running other clients, and provide a better platform for users
          around good APIs. gRPC in particular is attractive, and we would look at
        it in combination with complementing QUIC support.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p><strong>Double Spend Proofs and Notifications</strong></p>
        <p>This offers protection against fraudulent double spend attempts and
          help protect merchants and other businesses. Strengthens the utility
        of unconfirmed transactions as a means of receiving ordinary payments.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p><strong>UTXO/UtreeXO commitments</strong></p>
        <p>Allows new network nodes joining the network to be synchronized much
          faster, start mining demanding much less bandwidth from existing nodes, and
          provide new forms of lightweight wallet service. Important milestone towards
        massive scaling.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p><strong>Better block propagation with compatible Xthinner and/or Graphene</strong></p>
        <p>Graphene and Xthinner are scaling technologies that delivers big bandwidth
          savings in case of large blocks. While Graphene is still being optimized for
          better worst-case fallback rates, Xthinner is already relatively <a href="https://medium.com/@j_73307/benefits-of-ltor-in-block-entropy-encoding-or-8d5b77cc2ab0">well-defined</a>
          and understood to be robust in design, albeit delivering more modest best-case
          bandwidth savings. Evaluating and implementing either or both are important
        steps in massive scaling.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p><strong>Enable use of all processing cores during block validation</strong></p>
        <p>Currently the software does not use CPU cores as efficiently as it should.
          Many improvements are possible in this area and needed for further scaling,
        but it requires much careful engineering work.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p><strong>Evaluation of adaptive blocksize limit proposals with recommendation of
      new consensus rules and a reference implementation</strong></p>
      <p>Removing the fixed blocksize limit cuts down one potential future obstacle
        and a recurring item that would drive a need to hard fork the network
      in the case of major adoption.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Evaluate Storm or Avalanche as pre-consensus options</strong></p>
      <p>These protocols could be used as pre-consensus to enable the
        network to settle rapidly on one of several alternative unconfirmed
        transactions. This could protect against fraudulent double spends and
        bring faster pre-confirmation of transactions, strengthening BCH utility
        as electronic cash. While <a href="https://github.com/tyler-smith/snowglobe">Avalanche</a>
        and <a href="https://github.com/awemany/storm-sim/raw/master/whitepaper/storm-wp-2019-08-30.pdf">Storm</a>
        both have made progress in description, implementing them in safe, carefully
      considered stages requires much more work.</p>

      <p>Needs: 0,5 FTE until July, less after. We are able to execute on this using existing team members (web developer + experienced protocol engineer for back-end) - or may elect to use an external platform provider.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Maintenance / backporting: 48,000 USD</strong></p>
      <p>Needs: 0,5 FTE, we have several developers who could perform this task. For logistical reasons we may either share it across developers or contract further development resources with these funds.</p>
    </li>

      <p>Needs: 0.9 FTE over 10 weeks from mid August until end of October. Shifted back to allow prioritizing DAA and 64-bit ops work, but may be moved forward if we obtain additional donations outside this fundraiser that would allow us to contract another experienced developer.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Development / 64-bit ops: 24,800 USD</strong></p>
      <p>Needs: 2 FTE over 12 weeks from May until beginning of August.

    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Testnet infrastructure / Setup &amp; operation: 20,000 USD</strong></p>
      <p>Needs: more infrastructure expense than labor (estimated &lt; 0.25 FTE). Completion of this item will be managed (until beginning of November) by a founding BCHN contributor with experience in running other Bitcoin Cash infrastructure services.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Processes / ecosystem liaison role compensation: 30,000 USD</strong></p>

<p>We fall back to a more voluntary mode with less certainty, but continue

<h2 id="8-policies--processes--culture">8. Policies / processes / culture</h2>
<p>Bitcoin Cash Node prides itself on following open, transparent processes
which explicitly take ecosystem feedback to be a key ingredient.</p>
<p>We consider the group of Bitcoin Cash stakeholders to be wide and do not
  only focus on serving the interests of a particular subset. Our software
  is intended to be used in mission-critical settings which require high
  reliability and quality.  This requires a solid engineering approach and
  clear policies which we seek to address in our project documentation. To
  this end we have started setting up a project management repository in
  which we will deposit detailed plans covering the life cycle of our project
and its products.</p>
<p>In our project communication channels, we seek to promote an environment
  which is welcoming to all users regardless of their background or level
of experience.</p>
<p>We maintain mutual disclosure relationships with other software projects that
  practice responsible disclosure of security issues, so that the ecosystem
may benefit instead of being harmed.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Cash Node is committed to evolving transparent and accountable
processes both within its own project and within the larger BCH ecosystem.</p>
<p>The 6-monthly network upgrade cycle and very rapid client release cycles
  have been identified as sub-optimal, causing development centralization
and practical troubles even for its staunch proponents.</p>
<p>In consultation with users, BCHN will engage on well-considered adaptation
  of the upgrade cycle after November 2020 (the November upgrade is already
  encoded into the current software in terms of some parameters and cannot
simply be abandoned).</p>
<h2 id="9-accountability">9. Accountability</h2>
<ol>
  <li><p>Metrics for measuring individual deliverables</p>
    <p>These are described in the deliverables section above. Maintainer reports
      will aim to give an idea of percentage completion of deliverables and
    resources expended until a given reporting date.</p>
    <p>The project welcomes inquiries and feedback on useful metrics that its
    users may wish to see with regards to individual deliverables.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Accounting transparency and method of verification</p>
    <p>At the moment the project is reporting on income and expenditures in the
      lead maintainer reports [7, 8], but as the number and amounts of expenses rise,
      this will be split out into a separate financial report published by the
      project account on <a href="https://read.cash/@bitcoincashnode">https://read.cash/@bitcoincashnode</a> or on its website.</p>
      <p>In situations where expenses by the project have to be paid in fiat
        currency, these are generally borne by project members and reimbursed
      in BCH from the project donation wallet.</p>
      <p>Financial reports will include additional addresses if separate positions
        are created for specific activities (such as separate donation funds
        earmarked for specific features or activities) and if revenue streams other
      than general donations are received.</p>
      <p>Market volatility <em>may</em> require the project to stabilize part of its
        donation funds through hedging in stable coins, to protect their value.
        The project will consult internally, but it is thought appropriate that
        where such hedging takes place, it should be done using stable coins which
        are SLP (or other) tokens operating on Bitcoin Cash. This retains significant
      incentive alignment with a well-functioning Bitcoin Cash currency network.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Regular communication about progress</p>
      <p>The lead maintainer of the project commits to regular reporting
        (no less frequently than once a month, preferably every two weeks) on
      current project activities and their progress.</p>

    <h3 id="b-history-of-accomplishments">B) History of accomplishments</h3>
    <p>The BCHN project released its first version 27 February 2020, which has
      been met with a positive response by the ecosystem, including immediate
    uptake by some mining pools and other Bitcoin Cash businesses.</p>
    <p>The initial version was created out of necessity to provide a safe
      alternative to Bitcoin ABC for the 15 May 2020 network upgrade.
      It is being used to mine blocks on the Bitcoin Cash network,
    with on-chain signaling for its software by pools including Bitcoin.com.</p>
    <p>During the last two weeks of March, the BCHN project has conducted a
      public consultation to gather the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem's input on
    priorities for the development of the client and the currency network.</p>
    <p>This survey marks the beginning of an open process of interacting with
      the coin's ecosystem to guide the further evolution of the project's
    software and its development, deployment and governance processes.</p>
    <h3 id="c-history-of-budgets-and-disposition-of-funds">C) History of budgets and disposition of funds</h3>
    <p>The BCHN project currently operates solely on donated BCH which are kept
    on a multi-signature address at bitcoincash:prnc2exht3zxlrqqcat690tc85cvfuypngh7szx6mk .</p>
    <p>This address can be verified on the <a href="https://bitcoincashnode.org/#donate">project website</a>.</p>
    <p>The project has received a donation of 100 BCH from company that specializes in
      management and monitoring of SHA256 miners, and further donations of ~43.23 BCH
      from across the ecosystem. About 1.13 BCH were collected on the coin.dance
      (<a href="https://cash.coin.dance/development/#developersupport">https://cash.coin.dance/development/#developersupport</a>) and then transferred
    to the BCHN donation address.</p>
    <p>The project's financial situation has so far been reported by the lead
      maintainer in regular reports [7,8].
      Only a few minor expenses have been incurred for article
      translations amounting to less than 0.3 BCH. All income and expenses are
    publicly visible on the blockchain via the project's wallet address.</p>
    <p>Project funds on 4 April 2020 amounted to ~144 BCH.</p>
    <h3 id="d-current-operating-expenses">D) Current operating expenses</h3>
    <p>The project currently does not have large operating expenses.
    It is using free plans on several well known platforms:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>version control, continuous integration and bug tracking facilities
      is done on the free plan of gitlab.com</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>main development communications are done on an unpaid Slack
    (bitcoincashnode.slack.com) and Telegram</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally there are occasional translation services being engaged, for
which payers are being refunded by the project from its donated funds.</p>
<p>The website domain registration (<a href="https://bitcoincashnode.org">https://bitcoincashnode.org</a>) and site
  hosting are currently donated by project supporters. The project would
  currently be able to reimburse these private expenses and hopes to do so
in future.</p>
<p>The site domain is in control of a maintainer other than the lead maintainer.</p>
<h3 id="e-faq">E) FAQ</h3>
<ol>
  <li><p><strong>What happens if the fundraiser target is not reached?</strong></p>
    <p>Then Bitcoin Cash Node asks everyone who is willing, to donate directly
    to our multi-sig donation address.</p>
    <p>In the event of us not reaching our goals in this campaign, we will
    prioritize as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Maintaining the node over the next year versus <em>funding</em> major new
        developments.
        We will need to rely largely on volunteers to contribute labor to those
        efforts.
        It does not mean we will abandon new feature developments, only that we
        will not be able to pay for dedicated developers to work on them and must
        rely on volunteer efforts. Of course that also means that implementation
        and deployment timeframes for such features become more unpredictable and uncertain,
        since we cannot say in advance whether volunteer development resources
      will materialize, on what timeframe and in what quantity.</li>
      <li>Setting up our website to do fundraisers of our own will still be a priority,
        and if existing funds remain sufficient (market volatility needs to be
        taken into account), we will use them to reach crowdfunding capability.
        If existing funds are deemed inadequate, we may need to settle for
        fundraising which is not based on assurance contracts, but old-fashioned
      dedicated donation addresses per feature or work package.</li>
      <li>Seeking additional funding sources such as company sponsorships,
        signing support agreements, providing consultation services for businesses
        wishing to use BCHN, inviting third parties to do bounties for features,
      or selling hats :-)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><p><strong>Is there a legal entity or company associated with BCHN?</strong></p>
    <p>We see no immediate need for this, but will continue to evaluate this
    option as our organization grows.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><strong>Where will you keep the funds?</strong></p>
    <p>The funds from fundraisers like this one will be accumulated after
      collection in the project's main multi-signature wallet, where the total
    balance of funds and any movements are publicly visible.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><strong>Will we get to see how it is spent?</strong></p>
    <p>We intend to continue publishing financial reports that show in detail
    what our funds are spent on.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><strong>Will subsequent itemized fundraisers go into the same account, or to separate, earmarked accounts?</strong></p>
    <p>To simplify our payment processing, we intend to transfer all raised funds
      into our main multi-signature donation wallet.  We can easily account for
      all outgoing payments and the amounts collected by fundraisers or other
      revenue generated by our activities, and the general public can easily
    monitor our funding level, income and expenditures.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><strong>Some of your team are members in other client projects and organizations. Do you see any conflicts in those arrangements?</strong></p>
    <p>Bitcoin Cash Node is an open source project that welcomes contributions from
      anyone, including those who work on other client projects or even other
    cryptocurrencies.</p>
    <p>We view conflict of interest considerations as a personal ethical
      responsibility [10] and encourage our contributors to consider voluntarily
    disclosing potential conflicts they may have.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><strong>What if your intended people to work on items do not complete them on time or leave?</strong></p>
    <p>Different circumstances can arise during our quest to fulfil our promise
      on deliverables. While we will do our best to deal with unfortunate
      situations, whether we are successful or not, we will document our
    efforts transparently so you know where your money has been put to work.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><strong>What if the BCH price falls below the 20% buffer you guarded against?</strong></p>
    <p>In the event of a short-term fall, we continue to execute according to our
      plan but will deplete our reserves faster, which means we need to look at
      procuring additional funding to make up for the shortfall and carry out
    the deliverables.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><strong>What if the BCH price rises significantly? What will you do with the money?</strong></p>
    <p>The more value our funds gain, the more we can achieve with them without
      having to raise further funds. In other words we use the money to
      carry out the development needed on our road towards global peer to
    peer electronic cash.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><strong>Will you keep all raised funds in BCH or hedge some in stable coins?</strong></p>
    <p>This has not been finally decided, but we do intend to keep the majority
      of our funds (initially: all) in BCH. We are consulting with financial
      advisors on possibly hedging some funds in stablecoins that operate on
    the BCH network.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><strong>What happens if IFP is activated against all expectation?</strong></p>
    <p>In that case BCHN software will follow the most-proof-of-work chain.
      Since it does not implement the IFP rules, miners / pools should take
      note of actual ecosystem uptake and decide on their own whether to comply
      with the IFP rules in case they activate, as activation among ABC nodes
    does not equal actual adoption.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><strong>How can I help your project in ways other than donating money?</strong></p>
    <p>We are very grateful for any form of assistance whether it be a bit of
    your time or good advice or demonstration of support for our project.</p>
    <p>If you are a developer, software tester or can do technical writing
      or review, you can help us by contributing directly by working with us
    on one or more of the areas that interest you.</p>
    <p>If you are a Bitcoin Cash block producer, you can signal support for
      our project by including <code>/BCHN/</code> in your block coinbases.</p>
      <p>If you are a retail business using Bitcoin Cash, we hope that if you
      run a network node, you will try our software and give us feedback.</p>
      <p>If you are a Bitcoin Cash user in general, you can report issues or
        raise improvement requests through our presence on GitLab, or through
      any of our project's other channels.</p>
      <p>Please contact us on Slack, Telegram or IRC via the links on the
      website to find out more.</p>
